     Currently, Since i am second year student. i had been wasting my career for two and half years. Now i have realised that time doesn't stop for anyone. So I started to study just now.
     So basically I don't have any projects which i have started even now. I am currently learning how to such things and all. I hope I'll learn this very fast. Further I would prepare a lot of projects. I wish you'd see them.
